To combine PyTorch Lightning and MONAI without creating a mess, treat them as complementary layers:

⸻

1. Roles
	•	PyTorch Lightning = orchestration (training loop, logging, distributed, mixed precision, callbacks).
	•	MONAI = domain toolkit (medical transforms, datasets, metrics, prebuilt networks).

Keep Lightning as the outer shell, MONAI as the inner toolbox.

2. Architecture

my_project/
  data/
    datamodule.py   # LightningDataModule, internally calls MONAI Dataset/CacheDataset
  models/
    lit_module.py   # LightningModule, wraps a MONAI network and loss
  transforms/
    monai_transforms.py  # Compose() pipelines using monai.transforms
  engine
    train.py          # Trainer entrypoint


⸻

3. Workflow
	•	Data: In LightningDataModule, use monai.data.Dataset or CacheDataset with monai.transforms.Compose.
	•	Model: In LightningModule, instantiate MONAI networks (UNet, SwinUNETR) and losses (DiceLoss, FocalLoss).
	•	Training: Use pytorch_lightning.Trainer to handle GPU setup, checkpointing, early stopping.
	•	Metrics: Call MONAI’s metrics (DiceMetric, HausdorffDistanceMetric) inside validation_step.

5. Best practices
	•	One abstraction per layer:
	•	Don’t re-implement training loops → Lightning does it.
	•	Don’t re-implement transforms/losses/metrics → MONAI does it.
	•	Configs: Use Hydra/OmegaConf to avoid YAML duplication between Lightning and MONAI.
	•	Callbacks: Use Lightning callbacks for checkpoints/logging; keep domain logic in MONAI.
	•	Testing: Write unit tests for data transforms and model outputs to avoid silent shape mismatches.

This way Lightning is the scaffolding, MONAI is the content. You won’t end up with duplicated trainer code or duplicated transforms.
