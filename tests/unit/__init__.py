"""Unit tests for PyTorch Connectomics.

Unit tests test individual components in isolation:
- Configuration system (Hydra configs, dataclasses)
- Model registry and architecture builders
- Loss functions
- Augmentations and transforms
- Data utilities

These tests should be fast and have no external dependencies.
