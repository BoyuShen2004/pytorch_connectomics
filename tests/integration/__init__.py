"""Integration tests for PyTorch Connectomics.

Integration tests test multiple components working together:
- Lightning module + model + loss
- Data module + dataset + transforms
- Config system + training pipeline
- Auto-configuration and tuning
- Connected components and post-processing

These tests may be slower and may require test data.
